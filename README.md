# EnergySaving
This project contains:
  1. Datasets
  2. A jupyter notebook containing all the code I've written

The datasets are gathered from Singapore National Environment Agency.
The values for energy savings were provided to me.

The Jupyter notebook contains code for cleaning, validating and merging the data. It also contains visualisations made using matplotlib.
